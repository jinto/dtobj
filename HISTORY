Mission of this project was finding straight lines from fits a file. And 
the lines must be on a virtual straight line. Fortunatly I can found every
components from the internet. thanks to open source and stackoverflow.

Among the many line detecting codes, i decided using opencv's cvHoughLines2
which seems to be the best one after manual testing with sample fits files.

And another big help was William Cottons 'FITS2jpeg' which converts fits 
file to jpeg. I needed it cause OpenCV can not handle fits file directly.

At this stage, finding lines from a sample fits file took 5minutes and more 
on my macbook pro(core2duo 2.66mhz). So the last one was 'in-memory 
generation of jpeg' to eliminate unnessasary disk io. now it took 3minutes.
and tuning is not finished.
