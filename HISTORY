Mission of this project was finding straight lines which must be on a virtual 
straight line from a fits file. Fortunatly all components for this mission could
be found from the internet. Thanks to open source and stackoverflow.

Among the many line detecting codes, OpenCv's cvHoughLines2 seems to be the best 
one after manual testing on sample fits file.

Another big help was William Cottons 'FITS2jpeg' which converts fits 
file to jpeg. I needed it cause OpenCV can not handle fits file directly.

Finding lines from a sample fits file took 5minutes or more on my macbook 
pro(core2duo 2.66mhz). So 'in-memory generation of jpeg' is needed to eliminate 
unnessasary disk IO. now it took 2minutes.  and tuning is not finished.
